# Pokémon Crystal

This is a hand-crafted disassembly of Pokémon Crystal.

The source code in this project successfully converts back into a ROM image. All source code is meticulously commented.


## Base ROM

The following ROM is required for compiling:

```
Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.0) [C][!].gbc
md5: 9f2922b235a5eeb78d65594e82ef5dde
```

Eventually this will not be necessary.

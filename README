This is a disassembly of Pokémon Crystal.

It uses the following ROM as a base:
    Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.0) [C][!].gbc
    md5: 9f2922b235a5eeb78d65594e82ef5dde

To assemble, first install RGBDS and put it in your path.

The version of RGBDS needed is rgbds-linux:
    https://github.com/bentley/rgbds/
    git://github.com/bentley/rgbds.git

Then copy the Pokémon ROM to this directory as "baserom.gbc".
Then run "make" in your shell.

This will output a file named "pokecrystal.gbc".

Know ASM, but not your way around linux?  Want to help or just try out building pokecrystal on Windows, but got stuck 
somewhere along the way?  Fear not, for..  whatever, just follow this tutorial.

1. Get `cygwin`.  Cygwin provides a virtual linux enviorment on Windows systems.    Just get `setup.exe`: 
http://cygwin.com/install.html
   During the install:
   I.   Keep the defaults
   II.  It shouldn't matter which mirror you choose.  http://mirrors.kernel.org worked for me.
   III. Now you'll be presented with a package selection screen.  Select the following packages.  You may use the 
search.
        * `python` (installed by default)
        * `gcc`, `gcc-core` (under devel)
        * `byacc` (under devel)
        * `make` (under devel)
        * `wget` (under web)
        * `git` (under devel)
        * `mercurial` (optional, if you wish to work with pokered as well)
        * `nano` (optional, a simple terminal text editor)
   IV.  Finish the install.  Might take a sec while all packages are downloading.
2. Launch `cygwin`.
   Hopefully you know your way around the linux terminal.  If not, a crash course:
   * `ls` - list directory
   * `pwd` - write current directory
   * `cd` - change directory
3. First of all, we need to build `rgbds`, the GB compiler.  Type:
       $ git clone git://github.com/bentley/rgbds.git
       $ cd rgbds
       $ YACC=byacc make
       $ export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`
       $ echo "export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`" >> ~/.bashrc
   At this point, you should be able to close cygwin, reopen it and successfully run `rgbasm`.
       $ cd ~
       $ wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
       $ easy_install unittest2
   Now we should be able to build `pokecrystal` for the first time.
       $ cd ~
       $ git clone https://github.com/kanzure/pokecrystal.git
       $ cd pokecrystal
   Please download a Pokemon Crystal ROM and save it as `C:\cygwin\home\(your username)\pokecrystal\baserom.gbc`
       $ make
   This will take between 5 and 15 seconds, depending on your computer.
   If you see `cmp baserom.gbc pokecrystal.gbc` as the last line, the build was successful!  Rejoice!
   Now you may try messing around with `main.asm`, or just do whatever you wanted to.
   To build again, you should use the following command:
       $ make clean && make

Feel free to ask us on #skeetendo if something goes wrong (remember to tell where)!

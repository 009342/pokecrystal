#### Windows

Follow these instructions to install `pokecrystal` on Microsoft Windows. Once installed, you can run `make` to compile `main.asm` into a ROM.

1. Get `cygwin`. Cygwin provides a virtual linux environment on Windows systems. Just get `setup.exe`: 
http://cygwin.com/install.html

   During the install:

   I.   Keep the defaults
   II.  It shouldn't matter which mirror you choose. http://mirrors.kernel.org worked for me.
   III. Now you'll be presented with a package selection screen. Select the following packages. You may use the 
search.
        * `python` (installed by default)
        * `gcc`, `gcc-core` (under devel)
        * `byacc` (under devel)
        * `make` (under devel)
        * `wget` (under web)
        * `git` (under devel)
        * `mercurial` (optional, if you wish to work with pokered as well)
        * `nano` (optional, a simple terminal text editor)
   IV.  Finish the install.  Might take a sec while all packages are downloading.

2. Launch `cygwin`.

   Hopefully you know your way around the linux terminal. If not, a crash course:

   * `ls` - list directory
   * `pwd` - write current directory
   * `cd` - change directory

3. The next step is building `rgbds`, the GB compiler. Type:
       $ git clone git://github.com/bentley/rgbds.git
       $ cd rgbds
       $ YACC=byacc make
       $ export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`
       $ echo "export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`" >> ~/.bashrc

       # check if rgbasm is installed now
       $ which rgbasm
   (If that fails, you can download binaries here:
       http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/irc/pokered/rgbds/rgbds-5d6559f15f549c117ef80cbe7f4cb93669a2e5e3.zip
   )

   The next step is to install `unittest2`, unless you installed python2.7 earlier:
       $ cd ~
       $ wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
       $ easy_install unittest2

   Now you should be able to build `pokecrystal` for the first time.
       $ cd ~
       $ git clone https://github.com/kanzure/pokecrystal.git
       $ cd pokecrystal

   The final requirement is downloading a Pokemon Crystal ROM:
       Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.0) [C][!].gbc
       md5: 9f2922b235a5eeb78d65594e82ef5dde
   Save it as `C:\cygwin\home\(your username)\pokecrystal\baserom.gbc`.

   To compile the ROM from ASM source:
       $ make

   This will take between 3 and 15 seconds, depending on your computer.

   If you see `cmp baserom.gbc pokecrystal.gbc` as the last line, the build was successful! Rejoice! Otherwise it will show you an error message.

   Now you may try messing around with `main.asm`, or just do whatever you wanted to.

   To build again, you should use the following command:
       $ make clean && make

   Feel free to ask us on nucleus.kafuka.org #skeetendo if something goes wrong (remember to tell where)!
